# Acode Data

The __Acode Data__ directory, like all of the __App Data__ folders, contains everything you need to ruin your day. ðŸ™‚

So, even though it *should* go without saying, I will still be putting the following (or a nearly-identical) __[Warning]__ & __[Disclaimer]__ before we start messing with, in, or in the general proximity of *any World-Endi-*

Wait... sorry, I meant: *any (potentially)* __*App/System-Breaking*__ items of any kind. Blowing up the world isn't on me, so... have at it, I guess?


<br />

### Warning

Don't believe the old man *looking for his dog*. He doesn't have that extra candy and his dog probably died 10 years ago.


<br />

### Disclaimer

That isn't the real warning, and this isn't the real disclaimer. I just wanted to move on.

Oh, and that last message you got: that wasn't the real them either. ðŸ‘½
